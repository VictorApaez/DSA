# About this project

I created this repo to practice DSA!
Here you will find my own version of a LinkedList class. I will be adding leetcode solutions as methods to this class using Node and es6 classes.

1. **main.js** - centralized export for the data structure's class

2. **debug.js** - for testing purposes (Creating an instance of the class)

3. **className.js** - Class Definition with default methods and properties

4. **leet-code folder** - Leet Code solution that will be implemented into the Class

5. **tests folder** - Test cases for the Leet Code solutions using Jest
